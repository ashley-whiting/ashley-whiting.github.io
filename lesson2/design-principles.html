       <p>THIS WEBSITE DOESN'T FEEL THE NEED TO FILL SPACE WITH UNNECESSARY CONTENT, CREATING A CLEAN, CRIPS DESIGN. THIS COMPANY HELPS PEOPLE GET INTO HOMES, A FRUSTRATING EXPERIENCE SO A CLEAN DESIGN IMMEDIATELY GIVES THE USER A FEELING OF CALM.  </p>

        <p>THE CHEESECAKE FACTORY IS NOTORIOUS FOR HAVING MANY OPTIONS ON THEIR MENU TO CHOOSE FROM, WHICH CAN GET FRUSTRATING AND CAN OVERWHHELM THE USER. THIS MOBILE SITE DOES A GOOD JOB OF ORGANIZING THE CATEGORIES AND CREATING DROPDOWN MENUS TO BROWSE THROUGH. BY ELIMINATING THE IMMEDIATE OPTIONS, THE USER DOES NOT GET OVERWHELMED AND CAN EASILY BROWSE THROUGH THE MENU DEPENDING ON WHAT THEY WANT TO FOCUS ON. </p>
