            "bio": "My first experience with Grand Canyon was hiking into Thunder River with my brother Ross, from the North Rim. My two brothers both worked for Grand Canyon Whitewater’s sister company, Arizona River Runners in the 1970’s. They brought their stories back home to California and inspired me to go on my first private trip in 1983. While I was on the Colorado River water levels were drastic and Glen Canyon Dam was in danger of spilling over the top! Not long after I found myself as a guide on rivers in California."

            "bio": "While growing up in Tucson, AZ, my first exposure to the Grand Canyon came in 1991 with an introduction to the famous South Rim trails. My folks took the whole family down the South Kaibab and up the Bright Angel, with a couple nights at Phantom Ranch. Little did I know that I’d return 15 years later to this amazing place, which teaches me new lessons with every encounter. "
